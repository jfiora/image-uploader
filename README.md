# Image Uploader

This project is based on Image Uploader from Full-stack challenges series of devchallenges.io. You can see the original from [here](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx).

My main goal from these series of projects is to improve my skills on React and learn new technologies.

## Instalation

The installation of the project is pretty much like any other Node base project. For the client we have to run these commands:
    cd ./client
    npm i
    npm run dev
    
And for the server:
    cd ./server
    npm i
    npm start
    
 ## Live site
 
Personally, I would recommend deploy the client site on a free platform such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

In my own case, I have the application server running on my own home server and the client up and running on vercel. I'm not sharing the url because I use it as a substitute of iCloud and I don't like to share any information of me.
