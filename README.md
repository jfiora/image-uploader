# Image Uploader

This project is 

## Development Environment (Local)

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js v16 or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)

The installation of the project is pretty much like any other Node base project. First of all clone the repository and install the dependences:
        git clone git@github.com:jfiora/my-own-drive.git
        cd ./my-own-drive
        npm install

For the client we have to run these commands:
        cd ./client
        npm i
        npm run dev
    
And for the server:
        cd ./server
        npm i
        npm start
    
 ## Live site
 
Personally, I would recommend deploy the client site on a free platform such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

In my own case, I have the application server running on my own home server and the client up and running on vercel. I'm not sharing the url because I use it as a substitute of iCloud and I don't like to share any information of me.
